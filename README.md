<h3>How To Use</h3>
<p>All the projects listed here work on my box.</p>

I include these so yall can look at the POM files and fix any versioning issues you might have

<h5>Debugging</h5>
<p><b>NOTE: </b>Meake sure you change personal settings like the database login info in the application.properties file</p>
<br>
<p>If you get stuck with an issue on a project for more than 30 mins, download my project and run it.</p>
<p>If you still have issues then that means your problem is not in your code. It is in the software you are using</p>
<p>Maybe something didn't install right somewhere, or a path is off, etc.</p>
